## Project Overview

### Purpose
The SATYA IDS project is designed to provide comprehensive network security monitoring and threat detection capabilities. It combines multiple cybersecurity techniques to create a robust defense system against various types of network attacks including:

- Web-based attacks (XSS, SQL Injection, Brute Force)
- Network intrusions
- Malicious traffic detection
- Anomaly detection in network flows

### Real-world Problem Solving
Modern organizations face increasing cybersecurity threats with sophisticated attack vectors. Traditional signature-based detection systems are insufficient against zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs). This project addresses these challenges by:

1. **Automated Threat Detection**: Reducing the manual effort required for threat identification
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Providing immediate visibility into network security status
3. **Intelligent Analysis**: Using machine learning to identify patterns and anomalies
4. **Integrated Response**: Streamlining incident response through automated workflows
5. **Threat Intelligence**: Enriching alerts with external threat intelligence data

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Cleaning Module (`scripts/data_cleaning.py`)

**Purpose**: Preprocesses raw network traffic data for machine learning analysis.

**Key Functionality**:
- Loads network traffic data from ISCX dataset (Thursday-WorkingHours-Morning-WebAttacks.pcap_ISCX.csv)
- Removes irrelevant features and handles missing values
- Reduces dimensionality by selecting essential network flow features
- Encodes categorical labels into numerical format:
  - BENIGN → 0
  - Brute Force → 1
  - XSS → 2
  - SQL Injection → 3

**Selected Features**:
- Destination Port
- Flow Duration
- Total Forward/Backward Packets
- Packet Length Statistics
- Flow Bytes per Second
- Active/Idle Time Measurements

**Real-world Relevance**: 
This preprocessing is crucial for SOCs as raw network traffic contains thousands of features. The module identifies the most discriminative features for attack detection, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detection accuracy.

**Output**: 
- `cleaned_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset with selected features
- `Sampled frame.csv`: Balanced sample dataset for training

### 2. Feature Selection Module (`scripts/feature_selection.py`)

**Purpose**: Advanced feature engineering and selection for optimal model performance.

**Key Functionality**:
- **Variance Threshold Analysis**: Removes low-variance features that don't contribute to classification
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies and visualizes feature correlations using heatmaps
- **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Uses ensemble methods to rank feature importance
- **Standardization**: Applies Z-score normalization for consistent feature scaling
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Focuses on top contributing features

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Variance threshold filtering
variance_selector = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0.01)

# Random Forest importance ranking
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
importances = rf.feature_importances_

# Standardization for ML models
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

**Real-world Impact**: 
Feature selection is critical in cybersecurity where datasets can have hundreds of features. This reduces false positives, improves model interpretability, and enables real-time processing of network traffic.

### 3. Data Exploration (`notebooks/Data_Exploration.ipynb`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of network traffic patterns and attack distributions.

**Key Insights**:
- Dataset contains 170,346 network flow records
- Attack distribution:
  - BENIGN: 98.72% (168,166 flows)
  - Brute Force: 0.88% (1,507 flows)
  - XSS: 0.38% (652 flows)
  - SQL Injection: 0.01% (21 flows)

**Analysis Performed**:
- Statistical distribution analysis
- Label imbalance assessment
- Feature correlation studies
- Outlier detection

**Real-world Significance**: 
The severe class imbalance (98.7% benign traffic) reflects real network conditions where attacks are rare events. This analysis guides sampling strategies and model selection for production deployments.

3. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for robust predictions
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based learning
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Maximum margin classification with RBF kernel

**Performance Results**:
```
Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score
--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------
Logistic Regression | 100%     | 100%      | 100%   | 100%
Decision Tree       | 100%     | 100%      | 100%   | 100%
Random Forest       | 100%     | 100%      | 100%   | 100%
KNN                 | 75%      | 75%       | 100%   | 85.7%
SVM                 | 100%     | 100%      | 100%   | 100%
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Train-test split: 80% training, 20% testing
- Stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
- Pipeline architecture with preprocessing and classification
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimation

**Real-world Application**: 
These models form the core detection engine of the IDS. The high performance indicates effective feature engineering, though care must be taken to avoid overfitting in production environments.

### 2. Model Evaluation (`notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation and comparison of ML models with focus on overfitting detection.

**Advanced Metrics**:
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of True/False Positives and Negatives
- **ROC Curve Analysis**: Area Under Curve (AUC) for model comparison
- **Overfitting Detection**: Compares training vs. testing accuracy
- **Cross-validation**: K-fold validation for robust performance estimation

**Key Findings**:
- Most models achieve perfect performance on test data
- KNN shows signs of overfitting (95.3% train accuracy vs. 81.3% test accuracy)
- Random Forest and SVM demonstrate consistent performance across train/test sets

**Visualization Outputs**:
- Confusion matrices for each model
- ROC curves comparing all models
- Feature importance rankings
- Performance comparison charts

**Production Considerations**:
The evaluation framework is essential for SOC deployment, providing confidence metrics and helping select the most reliable model for real-time threat detection.
